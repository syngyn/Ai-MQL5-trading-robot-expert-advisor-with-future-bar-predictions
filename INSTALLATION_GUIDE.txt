1. Extract all files to a folder (e.g., C:\LSTM_Trading)
2. Double-click install.bat
3. Copy your EURUSD60.csv file to the main folder
4. Double-click train_model.bat (wait 5-15 minutes)
5. Double-click start_daemon.bat
6. Run your MT5 EA

âœ… DETAILED STEPS:

STEP 1: System Requirements
- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.8+ (will be checked by installer)
- 4GB+ free disk space
- 8GB+ RAM recommended

STEP 2: Install Python (if needed)
- Download from https://python.org
- IMPORTANT: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Restart computer after installation

STEP 3: Extract Package
- Extract all files to a permanent location
- Avoid spaces in folder path if possible
- Example: C:\LSTM_Trading\

STEP 4: Run Installer
- Double-click install.bat
- Wait for all packages to install
- If errors occur, check Python installation

STEP 5: Prepare Data
- Your CSV must be named exactly: EURUSD60.csv
- Required columns: DATE, TIME, OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, TICKVOL, VOL, SPREAD
- Minimum 1000 rows, 10000+ recommended
- Place in main directory (not in subdirectories)

STEP 6: Train Model
- Double-click train_model.bat
- Training will take 5-30 minutes depending on data size
- You'll see progress updates every 5 epochs
- Success message: "Training completed successfully!"
- Files created: models/lstm_model_regression.pth, models/scaler.pkl

STEP 7: Start Daemon
- Double-click start_daemon.bat
- Should see: "âœ… Model and scaler loaded successfully"
- Leave this window open while trading
- You'll see prediction requests from MT5

STEP 8: Connect MT5 EA
- Copy GGTH.mq5 to MT5 Experts folder
- Attach EA to EURUSD H1 chart
- Check EA settings match your system
- Should see GUI panel with predictions

ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING:

Problem: "Python is not recognized"
Solution: Reinstall Python, check "Add to PATH"

Problem: "pip install failed"
Solution: Run as Administrator, check internet connection

Problem: "EURUSD60.csv not found"
Solution: Check exact filename, must be in main directory

Problem: "Model training failed"
Solution: Check data format, ensure enough RAM available

Problem: "Daemon won't start"
Solution: Train model first, check file permissions

Problem: "MT5 EA shows 'Not Connected'"
Solution: Check daemon is running, verify file paths

Problem: "No predictions displayed"
Solution: Check data folder permissions, restart daemon

ðŸ“ž SUPPORT:

If installation fails:
1. Check Python version: python --version
2. Check pip works: pip --version  
3. Try manual install: pip install torch numpy pandas scikit-learn
4. Contact: Jason.W.Rusk@gmail.com

ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS AFTER SUCCESSFUL INSTALLATION:

1. Monitor training accuracy (aim for >60%)
2. Verify daemon receives requests from MT5
3. Paper trade for 1-2 weeks minimum
4. Gradually increase position sizes
5. Keep training data updated monthly

Remember: This is experimental software. Always test thoroughly!
